Add A GitHub Repository To Your Local Machine
=============================================

#In your favorite web browser
1. Go to your profile on github.com
2. Click on "Repositories"
3. Click "New" towards the top-right of the screen
4. Give your repository a name (no spaces or silly characters)
5. Give your repository a description. Be as descriptive as you can, explain the purpose of the repository 
6. Set your repository to "public" or "private," I suggest public unless required to keep with the spirit of GitHub
7. Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" box unless you have already run `git init` in a directory via Terminal
8. If you know you want to ignore a specific code language, select it in the "Add .gitignore" dropbox, we can add specific folders and files to this later on
9. Give your repository a usage license. I suggest looking at [this site](http://choosealicense.com/ "Choose A License"); I prefer the MIT license
10. Click, "Create repository"
